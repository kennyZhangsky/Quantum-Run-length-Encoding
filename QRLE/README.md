# Design and Implementation of Run-length Encoding on Quantum Computers for Resource-efficient Data Representation

This repository contains the ******** described in the article 
"Design and Implementation of Run-length Encoding on Quantum Computers for Resource-efficient Data Representation". 
It also includes a test suite to assess the reproducibility of the results presented in the corresponding paper.

## Installation

To use this code, you need to have Python 3 installed. You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```
conda create --name QRLE --file requirements.txt
```

Then, you can run the test suit:

```
python3 ./qrle_module.py
